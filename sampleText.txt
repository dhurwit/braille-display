I'm no petroleum scientist, but I've been working around the stuff for a long time. The oil recycling industry is incredibly adept at removing carbon based contaminates from waste oil. That is why it turns black, and if the graphene balls are undamaged, they could probably be recycled too. It's actually cleaner and cheaper to recycle used oil than to refine it from crude, with savings varying depending on the quality of the crude.
